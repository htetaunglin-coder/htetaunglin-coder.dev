## Introduction

Today, we’ll explore how React takes the code we write and renders it on the screen. Starting from the basics, I’ll break down the process step by step so you’ll understand:

- What happens when state changes.
- Core concepts like Reconciliation, Render Phase, and Commit Phase.
- How understanding React internals helps you debug errors.
- Why this knowledge is important for interviews and improving your confidence as a React developer.

If you know a fellow React developer who might benefit from this, feel free to share this post.
