## Introduction

Today, we'll explore how React takes the code we write and renders it on the screen. Starting from the basics, I'll break down the process step by step so you'll understand:

- What happens when state changes.
- Core concepts like Reconciliation, Render Phase, and Commit Phase.
- How understanding React internals helps you debug errors.

If you know a fellow React developer who might benefit from this, feel free to share this post.

Okay, before I start explaining anything, I would like to explain a few words that I'm going to mention a lot in this blog.

First is the word **UI**:

- UI means every part of the application that the user can see or interact with.  
  For example: buttons, text boxes, menus, layouts, and so on.

Next is the word **Render:**

- When we say _renders_, it means the browser takes the code we write, calculates everything, and shows the result to the user on the screen.

But in the context of React, rendering means calculating the UI based on our code and deciding what needs to be updated.

## Core concepts

Now that we know these basic words, let's continue with the **core concepts** we need to understand React's rendering process.

- [What is JSX](#what-is-jsx)?
- [React Elements](#what-is-react-elements)?
- [React Components](#what-is-react-components)?

I'll explain each of these one by one.

### What is JSX

JSX is a syntax that React gives us, so we can write UI using an HTML-like style inside a JavaScript file easily.

Normally, if we want to write HTML inside JavaScript, we have to put everything inside a string, like this:

```javascript
container.innerHTML = `
  <div class="card">
    <h1>T-Shirt</h1>
    <p class="price">$20</p>
    <button onclick="handleClick()">+</button>
    <p>Quantity: <span id="count">1</span></p>
  </div>
`;
```

Writing UI like this is uncomfortable.

The formatting is hard, events like `onclick` must be inside a string, syntax highlighting isn't good.
and it's also hard to detect errors.

So instead of writing UI as a string, we want something that looks more like real HTML, easy to read, and easier to write events like `onClick`.

And that's the reason why we use JSX.

```jsx
function Card() {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h1>T-Shirt</h1>
      <p className="price">$20</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>+</button>
      <p>
        Quantity: <span>{count}</span>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When you look at this code, it feels like writing real HTML inside a JavaScript file.
It is clear and easy to read.

But we call this **JSX**, not **HTML**.

Also, the browser cannot understand JSX. it only understands normal JavaScript.

So React automatically **converts (compiles)** JSX into normal JavaScript.

For example:

```jsx
const element = <h1 className="title">This is JSX!</h1>;
```

React converts this into:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { className: "title" },
  "This is JSX!"
);
```

React creates a function call, and this function returns a **Virtual DOM node**, also known as a **React Element**, which is just a JavaScript object.

So JSX is basically a shortcut that helps us write UI in a simple and clean way, instead of manually calling `React.createElement()` every time.

### What is a React Element?

We already saw that JSX is converted into `React.createElement()`. And that function returns a JavaScript object called a **React Element**.

For example, if we write:

```jsx
const heading = <h1 className="title">This is JSX!</h1>;
```

React turns it into:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { className: "title" },
  "This is JSX!"
);
```

And if we log this function, we will see something like this:

```javascript
{
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'title',
    children: 'This is JSX!'
  }
}
```

This object is what we call a React Element.

When you look at the object, the two most important parts are:

- **type** → represents the HTML element or React component.  
   Example: `h1`, `div`, `button` or a component like `Card`, `Box`.
- **props** → represents all the data inside the element.  
   This includes things like `className`, `style`, `onClick`, and the `children`.

So for the example above,

the type is -> `h1`, and

the props are -> `{ className: "title", children: "Hello World" }`.

### What is a React Component?

Now that we know what a React Element is, and understand where they come from.

So, let's have a look at what **React Component** actually is.

A **React Component** is simply a JavaScript function (or class) that **returns React Elements**.

Let's have a look at this function as an example:

```javascript
function Greeting() {
  return <h1 className="title">Hello World</h1>;
}
```

We have a `Greeting` function which returns a `JSX`.

And behind the scenes, React changes it to:

```javascript
function Greeting() {
  return React.createElement("h1", { className: "title" }, "Hello World");
}
```

As we learned earlier, `React.createElement()` returns an object - the React Element.

So since this function returns a React Element, we call it a React Component.

### Recap

To recap, we can remember them like this:

- **JSX** → makes UI easy to write. _Generates React.createElement() behind the scenes_
- **React Element** → the JavaScript object created from JSX
- **React Component** → a function that returns React Elements
