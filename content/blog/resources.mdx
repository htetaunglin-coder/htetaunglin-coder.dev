## Coding

I love watching videos and learning about tech, especially React. I prefer learning something deeply instead of having a very broad knowledge with little depth.

### React

#### React UI Rendering-process - (React < 16)

_Understanding React's UI Rendering Process_

<YoutubeIframe

  title="Understanding React's UI Rendering Process"
/>

This video explains how React updated the UI before Fiber existed. It helped me see what really happens when React renders the page.

#### React UI Rendering-process With Fiber (React 16+)

/>

From React 16, the render system changed to something called Fiber. These videos helped me understand it better.

### Next.js

#### Understanding Rendering Models

_Watch this if you know HTML_

I found this video really helpful for understanding how the web actually renders pages.
It explains the ideas in a simple way and made things clearer for me, especially when working with Next.js.

### Some of My Favourite Articles

#### Code quality and maintainability

[Kent C. Dodds — Colocation article:](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation)

This article taught me how to place my code in a better way. Keeping related things close together makes the project easier to understand and change later.

#### Data fetching in modern React

## Life

### Books

#### 1. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck

The part I like the most is the idea that pain and failure are not bad. They shape us and improve us. Instead of running away from them in the pursuit of happiness, we should face them and accept them. Another thing I learned is that you cannot “not care” about everything. You just have to choose what's worth caring about, something you're willing to struggle for.

If you want to know a bit more about the book without diving too deep, you might like this article. I really enjoyed it. It's written by the author himself, Mark Manson:
[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck)

#### 2. How to Win Friends and Influence People

Some people say this book feels outdated or even a bit manipulative, and I get why. If you use the ideas in a forced way, it can feel fake. But for me, it actually helped. I started listening more, not because I want something from people, but because I'm genuinely interested in their stories. If you want to get better at communication in a real, honest way, this book is worth a try.

### Psychology & Emotions

I watch a lot of [Dr. K (HealthyGamerGG)](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG) videos. His content helped me understand life, productivity, and emotions more than anything else.

#### Ego

_Dr K. Explains: Escaping Your Ego_

<YoutubeIframe

  title="Dr K. Explains: Escaping Your Ego"
/>

I watched this Dr. K video about ego, and it explained a lot of things I didn't understand before. It made me see how ego can affect the way we react to small things.

For me, having too much ego made my life harder. I would overthink, feel offended easily, or hold onto things longer than I should. After understanding how ego works, I slowly learned to step back a little.

#### Emotional Processing

_How To Move On In Your Life (Processing Emotions)_

<YoutubeIframe
  src="https://youtu.be/7AywxObPgeM?si=KopeSvcJHm7zTULD"
  title="How To Move On In Your Life"
/>

This is something I believe everyone should learn, especially men. We're taught to bottle up emotions and forget about them by drinking, working too much, or staying busy so we don't have time to feel anything.

I was never the same after watching this video. I learned how to actually deal with my emotions instead of running from them. Before this, I would distract myself with doom scrolling and playing games to avoid negative feelings at all cost.

Now I understand that feeling your emotions is how you move forward. Ignoring them only keeps you stuck.

#### Productivity

_Dr. K, How Do I Focus?_

<YoutubeIframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZPRX9X5V5I"
  title="Dr. K, How Do I Focus?"
/>

This one taught me how to understand and control my mind better.
I learned why I lose focus and what actually happens in my brain when I don't want to do something.

#### Stoicism

_Think Like a Philosopher King | Stoic Wisdom from Marcus Aurelius' Meditations_

<YoutubeIframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMwxrXNafK0&t=2501s"
  title="Dr. K, How Do I Focus?"
/>

Last but not least, I want to talk about stoicism and share a bit about my life.

I grew up around emotionally immature people. I used to get angry easily, argue about meaningless things, and wonder why they treated me the way they did.

Growing up in that environment, there were only two paths I could take. Either get consumed by it and become like them, or become someone who isn't much affected by it.

I'm lucky that I found stoicism. It changed everything.

Before learning stoicism, I would get really upset every time I had to deal with difficult people. Now I see them as challenges that build inner resilience. I'm not like this all the time though. Sometimes they still get on my nerves and I respond or argue back.

But even when I give in to those arguments, I always find a way to hold myself back and not make things worse.
